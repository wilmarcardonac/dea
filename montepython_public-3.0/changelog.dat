v2.2.1  + to avoid I/O bug, only max(R-1) written in chains during update
---------------------------------------------------------------------
v2.2.0  + Automatic update of the proposal density's covariance matrix, with
          or without MPI (for usage, see the description of option
          "--update UPDATE" in "run --help").
        + When analyse run, keep only the markovian part of the chains,
          unless you use the flag "--keep-non-markovian" in order to get
          better (but slightly biased) statistics.
        + When analyse run, new covmat is not computed anymore by default
          (to avoid interfering with possible on-going run in update mode).
          New covmat calculation can be forced with flag --want-covmat
----------------------------------------------------------------------
v2.1.4  + Points to Planck 2015 likelihoods (default TT, TTTEEE, lite)
        + New example files base2015*.param for Planck 2015
----------------------------------------------------------------------
v2.1.3  + Added SDSS LRG4 data (sdss_lrgDR4)
        + Additional functionality to compute and use fisher matrix
        + Added a --minimal flag for info to only compute covmat/bestfit
        + Corrected the sigma8 likelihoods: minimum requirement k_max>=1h/Mpc
----------------------------------------------------------------------
v2.1.2  + Fixed the ReadTheDocs website.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
v2.1.1: + Implemented a new observable, cosmic clocks, that measure the Hubble
	  rate at different redshifts. Full information can be found in
	  data/cosmic_clocks/README.txt (credits Licia Verde)
	+ Implemented the BAO measurements from WiggleZ, from 1401.0358v2. Use
	  the new likelihood, called WiggleZ_bao, in your parameter file.
	+ Added a new BAO data point from Ross et. al. 2014, available in
	  data/bao_2014.txt along with all the previous ones. Notice that all
	  reference to the historical and unfortunate rs_rescale is now gone -
	  all the data points are stored as if computed with the true value of
	  the sound horizon, and not the Eisenstein and Hu 98 formula. Thanks
	  to Antonio Cuesta for his help in annihilating this issue.
	+ Fixed the ReadTheDocs website.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
v2.1.0: + Implemented the JLA new SuperNovae analysis (arXiv:1401.4064). There
	  are two versions available, 'JLA' and 'JLA_simple' (the latter being a
	  faster version of the former, so they are mutually exclusive). Thanks
	  to Martin Kunz, Stefano Foffa, Yves Dirian and Valeria Pettorino for
	  their testing and help in debugging. The data being massive, you are
	  asked to download it manually.
        + Euclid fiducial likelihoods have been cleaned, and adapted to the
          latest version of the wrapper
	+ Implemented the POLARBEAR likelihood (measurement of the BB spectrum
	  in four bins at large ell, see arXiv:1403.2369).
        + Major rewriting of the 'analyze' module. Now handles arbitrary number
          of folders/set of files. The '--comp' flag has been removed - you
          simply specify more elements to the 'info' call.
	+ You can now combine parameters in 'analyze' (at your own risk, beware
	  of the priors), using a new dictionary in the 'extra plot file'. See
	  the example in 'plot_files/example.plot'
        + Unified scheme for handling complex parameters from CLASS.  You can
          now specify for instance 'm_ncdm__1', 'm_ncdm__2' as running
          parameters, and they will be treated correctly.
        + It is now possible to add derived parameters that were not chosen
          before the run began. Simply list the parameters to follow on an
          existing folder with the flag '-m Der', and the options
	  '--Der-target-folder' and '--Der-param-list'.
        + 'mpi_run' method reinforced - should now work on more possible
          configurations.
	+ Rewriting of the '--help' method, with long information printed if
	  '--help' is called, and short if '-h' is used instead. Credits to
	  Francesco Montesano.
	+ added a '--silent' option to avoid printing on-screen the steps in
	  parameter space.
	+ Fixed bao_2013.txt data, it now uses the right sound horizon, thanks
	  to Martin Kunz, Stefano Foffa and Yves Dirian for finding it.
        + Monte Python is now under the MIT License (permissive BSD-type
          license)

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
v2.0.5: + Nested Sampling can now be used with MPI - see the documentation.
        + The histograms are now also stored in files if the '--all' flag is
          specified.
        + Improved the communication with the classy wrapper, notably on the
          derived parameters - now the function `get_current_derived_parameters`
          does not need to know how Monte Python works, which is better.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
v2.0.4: + Importance Sampling implemented. You can ask for this by specifying
          the method flag to IS, `-m IS`. It also requires a starting folder,
	  `--IS-starting-folder something/` in order to work. The parameter file
	  must be identical to the one in the starting folder, excepted at the
	  level of the likelihoods. The method then reads the existing chains,
	  and compute the new likelihood and multiplicity, and stores this in a
	  new folder.
        + Bug-fix for the previously cleaned parser, notably in the analyze
          module.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
v2.0.3: + New BOSS BAO likelihoods - courtesy of the BOSS collaboration via Jan
          Grieb. There are now two possibilities, isotropic and anisotropic
          measurements.  See
          https://github.com/baudren/montepython_public/pull/9 for more details.
        + There are now options to also plot the comparison between two
          experiments (folders), not only on the 1d posterior distributions, but
          also the 2d posterior distributions (credits to Jan Grieb)
        + Separated the different way of calling MontePython (for running and
          analyzing), to improve clarity of the help messages when asking
          `MontePython.py -h` (credits Francesco Montesano). Note that
          compatibility is maintained with the old way of calling things! Note
          also that to obtain the help on the running, or information
          subcommands, you should call: `MontePython.py run -h` or
          `MontePython.py info -h`.
        + Tentative implementation of basic MPI support. With mpi, and mpi4py
          (the Python wrapper of MPI), you can now an arbitrary amount of chains
          on a cluster and prevent (normally) any name conflict.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
v2.0.2: + BICEP2 likelihood implemented. You can specify which field you want to
          use ('B', 'E', or 'T' so far according to their documentation), with
          the line: bicep2.fields = ['B', 'E']
          See the bicep2.param for reference.
        + You can now specify likelihood parameters directly in the parameter
          file. This overwrites any setting present in the .data file of the
          likelihood. Simply write: `mylkl.something = 'that'`.
        + Help messages have been improved with the help of Francesco Montesano.
          More improvements will come in the next version.
        + Improved error messages, reading of the conf file now supports the
          tilde character.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
v2.0.1: + Bug-fix from 2.0.0: the memory was not properly freed from CLASS
          calls. There was a problem with imports of the errors imported from
          the cosmological module.
        + Lots of optimization, improvements and fixing of the analyze module.
          It now runs much faster for heavy runs with hundreds of chains to
          analyze.
        + Fixed the routine in nested_sampling: `from_NS_output_to_chains()`,
          which was bugged. Now one can analyze properly the output from
          MultiNest, translate it to Monte Python format, and compute a
          covariance matrix.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
v2.0.0: + Over sampling implemented: it helps running with likelihoods with a
          high number of varying nuisance parameters.
        + **Repackaging**: the whole folder now should behave more like a proper
          python package. This included renaming the `code` directory into
          `montepython`, and moving the `likelihoods` folder inside this new
          `montepython`. Also, considering a `lkl` likelihood, instead of
          following the previous structure:
          `likelihoods/lkl/lkl.py and .data,
          you should now use:
          `montepython/likelihoods/lkl/__init__.py and lkl.data`.
        + Wrapping of the Cosmo Hammer within Monte Python. This should allow
          runs being able to scale on the biggest available clusters (big thanks
          to Joel Akeret and Sebastian Seehars for the help in implementation).
        + Wrapping of MultiNest within Monte Python, thanks to the already
          existing Python wrapper written by Johannes Buchner (big thanks to
          Jesus Torrado for coding most of the communication between MP and
          PyNS).
        + Experimental feature: automated separating in subfolders a run that
          was found by MultiNest to be multimodal (Jesus Torrado)
        + New WiggleZ analysis (Signe Riemer, David Parkinson)
        + First version of the test module, with basic functionalities being
          checked.
        + Convention of path changed to comply with Python standards

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-oOo-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

v1.2.5: + Compatible with CLASS v2.0.x
----------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.2.4: + Fixed behaviour for the -all option when analyzing folders.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.2.3: + Tentative error message to catch a typical error appearing when
          running with a badly initialized log.param file. It now states that
          you should probably remove the folder entirely.  It is not sure that
          this catches all types of situation, but it does catch some of them.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.2.2: + Several bug fixes. One with analyze module, that failed when a file
          was not complete (wrong number of columns) - fixed.  The two other
          were more serious, and detailed below:
        + When using as an input a covariance matrix containing less parameters
          than the current run, wrong numbers were used for the remaining
          proposal distribution - fixed
        + When running with *no* varying parameters, instead of using the values
          specified in the parameter file, the code would instead run with
          default Class values - fixed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.2.1: + Planck lensing is now working
----------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.2.0: + Added the Planck likelihoods (called Planck_highl, Planck_lowl,
          Planck_lensing and lowlike)
        + Added a Cholesky decomposition method to speed up sampling for
          likelihoods with a large number of nuisance parameters based on
          A.Lewis 1304.4473, which groups parameters by blocks of same speed.
        + Transfered the documentation to a sphinx-documentation. Most comments
          in the code have been replaced by docstrings, automatically extracted
          to create a web-site. You can now navigate the different functions,
          see the dependencies, see the source code in one convenient place.
        + Renamed both io.py and parser.py into io_mp.py and parser_mp.py (mp
          for Monte Python). It was conflicting with some installed packages of
          python, both being some very often used names.
        + Removed the comparison between input param and log.param: always
          choose the latest.
        + Changed the architecture of analyze.py file. The whole thing is no
          longer a class, but instead a collection of functions.  To exchange
          information between these functions, a new class called `information`
          has been created.
        + Removed the common.py file, merging its content (lockfile system) with
          io_mp.py. Note that the lockfile is still being tested (works on our
          machine)
        + Transfered the log_flag from being an indendent quantity being
          exchanged between data and likelihoods to a proper attribute of the
          data class. Since no comparison is done any-more, there was no reason
          to keep it this way anymore.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
v1.1.0: + Added the following likelihoods: SPT full data (called spt_2500 in the
          likelihood directory), compilation of BAO scale data "bao",
          compilation of quasar time-delay data "timedelay" and updated the
          value for hst (1103.2976)
        + To speed up the production of plots, you can play with a new extension
          defining the print-out format: use the command-line option "-ext png",
          or eps, or pdf (from the fastest to the slowest format)
        + Added a lockfile system, that should prevent a file from being written
          simultaneously by two programs, when launching several different runs
          at the same time.
        + Changed a detail in the input file syntax, concerning parameter prior
          edges. To leave the prior edge undefined, you can still use "-1" as
          before, or "None". But if your prior edge is really minus one (for
          instance for w), you can write "-1."
        + Function cosmo_update_arguments() modified for better readability and
          simpler use (this function allows to rename or remap input parameters
          at each step before passing them to CLASS). The syntax pattern "try,
          except" is not needed anymore

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
v1.0.1: + Removed the first and unwanted line of code/mcmc.py, that was
          pointlessly trying to import again Class. This conflicted in case of a
          non-installation of the Class wrapper.
        + Modified '0.9' in '1.0' in a print statement in MontePython.py
----------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.0.0: + Initial release
