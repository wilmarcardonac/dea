   :synopsis: Monte Carlo procedure
.. moduleauthor:: Benjamin Audren <benjamin.audren@epfl.ch>

This module defines one key function, :func:`chain`, that handles the Markov
chain. So far, the code uses only one chain, as no parallelization is done.

The following routine is also defined in this module, which is called at
every step:

* :func:`get_new_position` returns a new point in the parameter space,
  depending on the proposal density.

The :func:`chain` in turn calls several helper routines, defined in
:mod:`sampler`. These are called just once:

* :func:`compute_lkl() <sampler.compute_lkl>` is called at every step in the Markov chain, returning
  the likelihood at the current point in the parameter space.
* :func:`get_covariance_matrix() <sampler.get_covariance_matrix>`
* :func:`read_args_from_chain() <sampler.read_args_from_chain>`
* :func:`read_args_from_bestfit() <sampler.read_args_from_bestfit>`
* :func:`accept_step() <sampler.accept_step>`

Their usage is described in :mod:`sampler`. On the contrary, the following
routines are called at every step:

The arguments of these functions will often contain **data** and/or **cosmo**.
They are both initialized instances of respectively :class:`data` and the
cosmological class. They will thus not be described for every function.

def get_new_position(data, eigv, U, k, Cholesky, Rotation):
    """
    Obtain a new position in the parameter space from the eigen values of the
    inverse covariance matrix, or from the Cholesky decomposition (original
    idea by Anthony Lewis, in `Efficient sampling of fast and slow
    cosmological parameters <http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.4473>`_ )

    The three different jumping options, decided when starting a run with the
    flag **-j**  are **global**, **sequential** and **fast** (by default) (see
    :mod:`parser_mp` for reference).

    .. warning::

        For running Planck data, the option **fast** is highly recommended, as
        it speeds up the convergence. Note that when using this option, the
        list of your likelihoods in your parameter file **must match** the
        ordering of your nuisance parameters (as always, they must come after
        the cosmological parameters, but they also must be ordered between
        likelihood, with, preferentially, the slowest likelihood to compute
        coming first).


    - **global**: varies all the parameters at the same time. Depending on the
      input covariance matrix, some degeneracy direction will be followed,
      otherwise every parameter will jump independently of each other.
    - **sequential**: varies every parameter sequentially. Works best when
      having no clue about the covariance matrix, or to understand which
      estimated sigma is wrong and slowing down the whole process.
    - **fast**: privileged method when running the Planck likelihood. Described
      in the aforementioned article, it separates slow (cosmological) and fast
      (nuisance) parameters.

    Main function of this module, this is the actual Markov chain procedure.

    + choose randomly a new point following the *proposal density*,
    + compute the cosmological *observables* through the cosmological module,
    + compute the value of the *likelihoods* of the desired experiments at this

      the last accepted one.

        to use the code to set a fiducial file for certain fixed parameters,
