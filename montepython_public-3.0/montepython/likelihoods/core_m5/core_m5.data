# CORE M5 is modelled as in the CORE papers for the M5 ESA proposal:
# Di Valentino et al. 1612.00021 and Finelli et al. 1612.08270

# This likelihood builds on the fake planck bluebook likelihood,
# modified to include B-modes and the CMB lensing potential. It is 
# possible to use the lensing auto- or cross-correlations alone,
# in combination with temperature and polarization, or for delensing
# the temperature and polarization spectra (e.g. if both lensing and
# B-mode polarization is desired).
