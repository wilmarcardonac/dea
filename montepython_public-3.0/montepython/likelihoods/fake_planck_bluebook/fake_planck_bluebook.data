# Here, Planck is modelled as in the bluebook:
#
# http://www.rssd.esa.int/SA/PLANCK/docs/Bluebook-ESA-SCI(2005)1_V2.pdf
# page 4, Table 1.1 (only the best three HFI channels: 100, 143 and 217 GHz)
#
# This is a rather conservative model since the sensitivities are
# based on 14 months of observations instead of 30

# where to read/write fiducial model:

fake_planck_bluebook.data_directory     = data.path['data']
fake_planck_bluebook.fiducial_file      = 'fake_planck_bluebook_fiducial.dat'

# experimental sensitivity:

fake_planck_bluebook.l_min              = 2
fake_planck_bluebook.l_max              = 2500
fake_planck_bluebook.f_sky              = 0.65
fake_planck_bluebook.num_channels       = 3

# angular resolution
# theta_fwhm must be in in arcmin

fake_planck_bluebook.theta_fwhm = [10., 7.1, 5.0]

# resolution for Temperature and Polarisation
# sigma's must be in muK.arcmin
# (with respect to Table 1.1 in bluebook, obtained by mutiplying
# angular resolution * DT/T * 2.726 )

fake_planck_bluebook.sigma_T = [68.1, 42.6, 65.4]
fake_planck_bluebook.sigma_P = [109.4, 81.3, 133.6]
