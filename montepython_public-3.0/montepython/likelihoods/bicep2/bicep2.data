# BICEP2 likelihood is provided in the bicep_util.py file. It is a copy of
# the official bicep_util.py file recovered from bicepkeck.org. The only
# modification was to add a Keyword Argument 'root' to many functions, to allow
# for searching in a different directory. None of the analysis was changed.
bicep2.data_directory  = data.path['data']
# You should specify here the field you want for the analysis.
# The valid entries are:
# B, E, T, (as of this version of their likelihood code, that is all).
