    Launch a simple MPI run, with no communication of covariance matrix

    Each process will make sure to initialise the folder if needed. Then and

    allows for initialisation over an arbitrary cluster geometry (you can have
    a single node with many cores, and all the chains living there, or many
    nodes with few cores). The speed loss due to the time spend checking if the
    folder is created should be negligible when running decently sized chains.

    Each process will send the number that it found to be the first available
    to its friends, so that the gathering of information post-run is made
    easier. If a chain number is specified, this will be used as the first
    number, and then incremented afterwards with the rank of the process.
